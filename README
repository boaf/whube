===================        TECHNICAL SHIT          =====================
========================================================================

What you will need:
  * GNU/Linux 
     ( I'm sure you could get this to work with windows, but that's
       just all kinds of dumb. Don't use nonfree crap.
       PLUG: USE UBUNTU! IT WORKS GREAT! <3 UBUNTU!                 )

  * Apache2
     ( Anything that supports the .htaccess file in the root, with
       rewrite rules.                                               )

  * PHP
     ( Well, the whole thing is written in PHP. If you ported this
       chances are it's not Whube anymore. Ship of Theseus kinda 
       thing. Although this is not the forum for such talk          )

  * MySQL
     ( Out of any of the things above, this is the most flexible. 
       All you have to do is rewrite model/sql.php to work with 
       whatever SQL server you fancy. Rewrite dbobj if you don't
       want SQL. Although that, is kinda dumb.                      )
